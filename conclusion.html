        <h1>NORTH CAROLINA MUSEUM OF NATURAL SCIENCES</h1>
        <h2>Conclusions</h2>
            <p>Parents and guardians take on a unique role when taking their children to museums. Science and History museum exhibitions are designed to display artifacts and educate the public. Schools may take field trips to museums, but it is more likely that parents are bringing their children to the museum, so the parents become the teacher. Being the most knowledgeable one among their children, parents are expected to navigate through the museum, read the signage, and start educational conversations to benefit the youth. </p>

<p>From my observations and research, I have concluded that the NCMNS can benefit from these main points: Creating signage that prompts conversations between adults and children, and perhaps even between strangers, could contribute to an amenable atmosphere and thus making the signage take a significant role in user experience. Finding a flexible wayfinding system that remains unobtrusive and lifts the burden of confusion from the user’s shoulders would probably be the most beneficial to any museum environment.</p>
            <p id="p01">“Ease of navigation will impact a visitor’s impression of an environment. Confusing signage will leave a negative impression on visitors and discourage repeat visits, whereas an easily navigable environment will leave a positive impression on visitors and encourage them to return.”</p>

<p>The role of most museums is not only to enlighten the public with knowledge but to cultivate a narrative for every visitor so that they are encouraged to learn. The space they reside in should provide enough logical navigation that the space feels welcoming without expediting their journey to the point of weariness. For spaces meant for children, such as the NCMNS, it may be useful to serve the parents as well through relevant and instructional signage so that they can take on a teacher role and better assist their children. Control over the dimensional qualities of a museum setting and wayfinding can combine to generate worthwhile moments for users.</p>
