        <h1>NORTH CAROLINA MUSEUM OF NATURAL SCIENCES</h1>
        <h2>An Overview</h2>
        <p>
        Museums often face problems when designing for user experience. Users will visit museums to learn information about events in history, science, art, etc., but will not visit or return if an aspect about the setting of the museum dissuades them. The atmosphere of the museum could be compromised because the exhibits are not organized appropriately or if the lighting is unfitting. Most often, spatial layouts and wayfinding and signage become the main problem and seem to never reach a point of perfection.</p>

<p>Through my observations at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences (NCMNS) in Raleigh, North Carolina, I have found that ineffective wayfinding can greatly impact a visitor’s experience at the museum. There are plenty of ways to find one’s way around the museum: maps, directories, and signage, but the wayfinding system hasn’t been perfected quite yet. After interviewing staff and visitors, the one problem that is most relevant to the museum faces is the lack of instruction available to inform visitors that the museum is made up of two buildings connected by bridges. </p>

<p> The two buildings are the Nature Exploration Center, which was built about twenty years ago, and the Nature Research Center, which was built about seven years ago. While the general ambience of the museum lends itself to be an immersive experience for people of all ages, confusing spatial layout and signage can still impede on a successful user experience.</p>
