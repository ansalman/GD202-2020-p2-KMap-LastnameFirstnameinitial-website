        <h1>NORTH CAROLINA MUSEUM OF NATURAL SCIENCES</h1>
        <h2>Wayfinding</h2>
            <div class="textcolumn">
                <p id="p01">“A lot of people can’t figure out that there’s two buildings. They show up in the Nature Research Center and they think this is the museum, this is the whole museum. And they’re shocked to find out there’s four more floors of exhibits open to them next door, and most of the animals next door.”</p>
            <p>Parents and guardians take on a unique role when taking their children to museums. Science and History museum exhibitions are designed to display artifacts and educate the public. Schools may take field trips to museums, but it is more likely that parents are bringing their children to the museum, so the parents become the teacher. Being the most knowledgeable one among their children, parents are expected to navigate through the museum, read the signage, and start educational conversations to benefit the youth. </p>

<p>In the dissertation “Museum Signage as Distributed Mediation to Encourage Family Learning,” Kyungyoun Kim expresses that parents may shyly withdraw from explaining exhibition content to their children if they lack in that area of understanding, “This finding  suggests that parents in museums are not always knowledgeable mediators for their children.”</p>

<p>Signage, therefore, becomes to be of great importance for museums. If the children’s guardians do not find themselves to make meaning out of existing informational displays, educational conversations cannot develop. “[W]ell-designed signage and its proper installation on the museum floor can increase visitors’ signage reading rate. However, these studies are limited in the extent to which they provide further information on how visitors make use of signage as a tool to support talk or how signage changes visitor’s meaning making and learning.” Creating signage that does prompt conversations between adults and children, and perhaps even between strangers, could contribute to an amenable atmosphere and thus making the signage take a significant role in user experience.</p>
              <p id="p00"><img src="screenshots/Upto3gradient2.jpg" width="140" height="140"> I noticed that the large white columns that are scattered throughout both buildings of the museum have minimal wayfinding text on them. While a clever use of signage, the text was always placed pretty high on the column, and it made me wonder how often they are noticed, even by adults. The printed text is also very old and often I found that letters had fallen off.</p>
                

<p>David Raphael, a landscape architect and planner, speaks about how wayfinding systems would not be successful and effective without the users at the center. His journal Wayfinding: Principles and Practice, 2nd Edition contains topics on the human behavioral patterns and their role in the design process, especially in regard to wayfinding, so this source becomes fairly relevant to designing signage for museum visitors. Noteworthy wayfinding is revealed when visitors return to the area repeatedly.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, wayfinding systems cannot always be tested behind the scenes, and one can only find problems within them once they go public. When I interviewed Bob Alderink, the coordinator of visitor programs at the NCMNS, he spoke about how adaptable his work is. He mentioned that if a problem arises, he’s able to quickly discard a previous method and begin a new one with little detriment; whereas, with his past position, a lot of money was wasted on fruitless plans. Finding a flexible wayfinding system that remains unobtrusive and lifts the burden of confusion from the user’s shoulders would probably be the most beneficial to any museum environment. Producing a valuable museum experience requires attention to the space itself. Tim Montgomery from the University of Sheffield, United Kingdom, has researched the importance of “space management” and “spatial context” in a classroom setting as they play a role in meaning making in the educational process. </p>
                
                <p id="p00"><p id="p00"><img src="screenshots/Column%20Signagegradient2.jpg" width="140" height="180">Lisa Yow, the Art Director at NCMNS whom I interviewed commented, “I mean, there’s so much to see. Like how do you put a sign up and not have it be obtrusive?” This suggests signage and wayfinding is needed, but don’t have many spaces to fill since the museum already has so many exhibits.</p>
            
<p>A positive user experience stems from the visitor’s self-assuredness when navigatingthrough the paths of a museum. Wayfinding also becomes of use here as guiding the visitor with unobtrusive signage, “a reduction in complexity of choices,” and using “spatial cues” allows the visitor to feel confident and “[move] through the educational space with logical ease.”. Montgomery also found within his research that the entrances and exits play valuable roles in the educational experience. Information is initially received in the very beginning of the museum experience, which is walking through the front doors. </p>

<p>Giving attention to this first step may positively alter the visitor’s impression of the museum by establishing a certain narrative as soon as they enter. Montgomery also comments, “Similarly, and perhaps more notably, leaving is also a distinct spatial and pedagogical moment. The museum found that there are exit gradients, whereby visitors speed up when they see the exit,” and then relates it to the final moments of a seminar and says these junctures “unravel the narrative.” Through my observations, it would seem that the researchers and designers of the NCMNS have already accomplished deeply engaging ambiences, but perhaps the exit and entrance gradients could be addressed.  </p>
